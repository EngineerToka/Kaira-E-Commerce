# E-commerce Web Application

This is a simple e-commerce web application where users can register, log in, browse products, and add them to a shopping cart. The project is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and uses `localStorage` to store user and cart data. It includes basic functionalities such as registration, login, cart management, and session handling.

## Features

- **Product Categories**: Fetches and displays product categories from an API.
- **Product Display**: Displays a list of products with image, title, description, and price.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to the shopping cart and view the cart items.
- **Cart Summary**: Displays the cart summary, including the total price and shipping options.
- **Logout**: Users can log out, which removes the session data and redirects them to the login page.
